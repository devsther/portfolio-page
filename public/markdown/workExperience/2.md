Before automation, human resources were inefficiently used as all HR/productivity reports were generated using Excel. It not only had a high risk of error but also caused a huge burden dealing with ~100K monthly data for each department.

#### Automation
- Using Python pandas, numpy, and plotly, created a local automated reporting system (HR, SVA, SAP data used)
- Reduced the annual financial budget (human resource) by approximately 8k dollars (resulting in a 50% increase in wages).
- Developed algorithm for automatic ticket generation system via Java

#### Data Analysis
- By visualizing data and analyzing using Python, contributed to providing a prediction model for areas of hospitals needing service to maximize efficiency in the usage of Human Resources for cost reduction.

#### Technologies Used
`Python` `R`
