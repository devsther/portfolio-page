#### Daily task
- Using Python and Minitab, analyzed cell growth rate depending on various growth factors based on data

#### The main project involved two parts:
1. Implementing data analyzing and prediction skills (python & Minitab) to modify Se & Fe
supplement concentrations in media based on experimental data.

2. Creating an automatic feedback control system based on real-time VCD to optimize CSPR. Through minimizing media usage while providing the optimal amount of media in N-1 perfusion. Expected to reduce the financial budget by approximately 81k per year.

#### Technologies Used
`Python` `Minitab` `R`
